# EVE Online Swagger Interface in Java

This repository is a wrapper Java API around the [EVE Swagger Interface](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#/) (ESI).

## Quick Start

*   Download this repository

*   Run
    -   On Linux/Mac: `./gradlew build`
    -   On Windows:   `gradlew.bat build`

*   Look at `org.devfleet.esi.ESIClient`. You should know what to do.

## Status

This API is in a very early stage and everyone is welcomed to fill the gaps.
Also note that since it builds on ESI directly, build will break on each ESI change.
